  <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
  <p>They come back as strings, regardless of what it is.</p>
  <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
  <p>It just accepts it, and the variable is undefined.</p>
  <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
  <p>They definitely could guess what my variables go to, I named them based off the of the questions. So "What is your name?" got a variable of "name", because it is the name of the person that is being asked the question.</p>
  <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
  <p>I would probably change the name of the variables, because more than likely it would no longer make sense...depending on the quesiton, I suppose.</p>
  <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
  <p>Normally, with HTML a form can be used. The advantage of the prompt is it cannot be overlooked, it's very in your face and hard to miss. The disadvantage is, is it could get annoying quickly having several of those pop up.</p>
  <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
  <p>It does not appear as if you can do so, by default although it looks like you may be able to with jquery, or some custom overlay dialoge in javascript.</p>
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
