  <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "404 Error"? "Error 404"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
  <p>It is possible to parse the number "404 Error", because the number is listed first. You cannot parse our "Error 404", because you get a NaN error. It will not find the number.</p>
  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
  <p>You will get an NaN, error. Not a number.</p>
  <h2>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h2>
  <p>Perfect example is that of your tic tac toe game, to keep track of scores of games, or loops.</p>
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
