  <h1>Javascript Questions</h1>
  
  <h2>1. What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>How do you check for sure, that your console.log() is working? What developer tools can I use? - Figured this out!</p>
  
  <h2>2. What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>alert() is a message that pops up in the browser, console.log() only shows up as a debugging tool? (May be making this up...need to verify.)</p>
  
  <h2>3. What's one situation where you might use an alert() to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>It could definitely come in handy if they're about to log out, or if their session times has expired, or they're missing information on a form that they still need to type in.</p>
  
  <h2>4. What's one way that alert() might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>If it's alerting to things that don't really need to be pointed out. Nonsensical overusage.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>No, it doesn't actually show up on the screen.</p>
  
  <h2>6. What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>Debugging your code.</p>
  
  <h2>7. When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p>It runs linearly, so in this case it runs after the first alert is clicked out of. - Edit, just checked...it does infact run as I had assumed.</p>
