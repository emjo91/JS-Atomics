  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
<h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
<p>It helps keep code more DRY.</p>

<h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
<p>It's much much more descriptive to use "hairColor" rather than "hc". You in three months may or may not remember what "hc" is.</p>

<h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
<p>I would imagine in about the same manner as we do in Ruby. Possibly create objects with them, and use it for more complex code.</p>

<h2>What happens if you assign a value to a variable, do some output with it, then assign a different value to that variable before doing more output. Will the displayed value from the first output update itself once you re-assign that variable to a different value?</h2>
<p>I believe mine updated itself, then also said it was now undefined...</p>

<h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
<p>Will come back to this quesiton.</p>

<h2>Try removing the keyword var from any line where it might show up in your program. What happens? Does your program still work as intended? Do any error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
<p>It still runs, but these are simple programs so far.</p>

<h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>What is the difference between a string and an integer? What kinds of information can you use in each? Why might you use one instead of the other?</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>What questions do you have?</h1>
