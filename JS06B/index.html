  <h3>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h3>
  <p>Yes, for MY particular password, it is case sensitive and does not allow capitals. However, that could be changed if I were to downase the user_answer.</p>
  <h3>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h3>
  <p> The single = will not work. The double and triple will, however, the tripples should probably be used.</p>
  <h3>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file? (Hint: there are at least two reasons)</h3>
  <p> Well, for one, someone could look it up easily in the web dev, or in page source.</p>
